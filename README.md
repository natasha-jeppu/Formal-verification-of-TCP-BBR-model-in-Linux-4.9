# Formal-verification-of-TCP-BBR-model-in-Linux-4.9
TCP BBR is a recently proposed algorithm by Google. Itâ€™s design is significantly different than the TCP extensions proposed in the past 30 years. BBR algorithm has been implemented in Linux 4.9. This project aims to formally verify the implementation of this algorithm.
